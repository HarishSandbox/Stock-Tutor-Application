# Stock-Tutor-Application
An application that helps users who are new to investing to learn about investing in a Stock Market. Similar to virtual gambling, our application will not use real money and investment. Instead it will allow the user to create investment portfolios, try out buying and selling of stock, and various investment strategies to see how they can grow (or shrink) their money with time.

Key Implementations:
* The project is built using MVC architecture. 
* View is designed using Java Swing.
* The project fetches realtime stock data using Alpha Vantage API
